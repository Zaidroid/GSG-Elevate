## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ **Google Cloud Setup (Required)**

#### 1. Create Google Cloud Project
```bash
# Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 1. Create new project: "Market Access Management"  
# 2. Enable APIs: Drive API, Sheets API, OAuth2 API
# 3. Note down your PROJECT_ID
```

#### 2. Create Service Account
```bash
# In Google Cloud Console:
# 1. Go to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
# 2. Create service account: "market-access-service"
# 3. Assign roles: "Editor" for Drive access
# 4. Generate JSON key file and save securely
```

#### 3. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
```bash
# In APIs & Services → Credentials:
# 1. Create OAuth client ID (Web application)
# 2. Add authorized redirect URIs:
#    - https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
#    - http://localhost:5000/auth/callback (for testing)
# 3. Save Client ID and Client Secret
```

### ✅ **Environment Variables Setup**
Your application needs these secret keys (already configured in your Replit):

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database

# Google OAuth (for user authentication)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret

# Google Service Account (for automated operations)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# AI Services

## 🗂️ Google Drive Structure Setup

### **Step 1: Initialize Drive Structure**

Once deployed, run this API call to set up your Google Drive:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/google/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This creates:
```
📁 Market Access Management System/
├── 📁 Companies/
│   ├── 📁 Company A - Documents/
│   ├── 📁 Company B - Documents/
│   └── 📁 Company C - Documents/
└── 📁 Templates/
    ├── 📄 Legal Framework Template
    ├── 📄 Market Entry Checklist
    └── 📄 Compliance Report Template
```

### **Step 2: Master Tracking Spreadsheet**

The system automatically creates a master spreadsheet with these sheets:

### **Step 3: Automated Synchronization**

Enable real-time sync between database and Google Sheets:

```bash
# Manual sync (for testing)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/google/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"spreadsheetId": "your_spreadsheet_id"}'

# Automated sync runs every 15 minutes (configurable)
```
